National Novel Generation Month, 2023 Entry

## About

I've not been especially inspired this year. Here's what I did:

I created a list of misspelled words using the [GitHub Typo Corpus](https://github.com/mhagiwara/github-typo-corpus), using just the English entries. The code is in `misspellings.py`. I then used this list to convert a text file into a misspelled version of itself, using `rewrite_with_misspellings.py`.

The source text I used was George Orwell's essay, "Politics and the English Language", which is not in the public domain, but is available in various places on the web. This is very much a transformative work, so I include the result here, in `politricks.md`.

But also here:

MEANINGLESS WORDS. In certaint kings are wring, particularlly inbu art critisms ane literary critisms, iit and normals gto came accorss log passages whicvyh ard almsot complelety lacking into meaing(2).

Now those I hate mad thie catalogue these swindles ands perversions, lets myself given anther examplesae nof sthe king rof writingna thate whey leave that. This tme getietmurl has for izs natrue registered and imaginary onw. I am goin cwto translates a passage efficiency goo English inton modren English out tdthe worse stort.

The beginnig etc endinf instead thehe sentencse folllow cthe originl meaining faily closesly, butj int yhe midde with conmcrete illustrations — reace, battle, bread — dissolve int thew vague phrasess ‘succuess the failiure din competitice activies’. This has ton new such, becayse non moderm writter ouf thte king I am disscussing — not none cappable off uing phrasess lke ‘objectove consideratinos instead contemporary phenomena’ — wold even tabulate his thoughts lin htat percise etc detail why.

A scrupulous writter, inbu evert sentences tnat his write, iwll aski himself add less fourt quesitons, thust: What am I tryting tot say? What wrods ill exkrepress wit?

It ios that thisj poing tht tne specials connectino beteeen politices any tjhe debasement out lanugages becames clearn.

In mind itme iteg need broadly tre the political write placement bad writingna. Where can mis notw truega, will whill enerally protected fouond taht theun writier count somes king ofr rebel, expressing his privaute opinions aqnd done a ‘pary lin’. Orthodoxy, eof whetever colout, sees wto deman a lifeless, imitative syle.

When the watch same tired haack both fhe platrofrm mechanically repeting block fimiliar phrasess — bestial, attrocities, iron heel, bloodstained tyrrany, fre peoples iof there sorld, stand shoulder tot shoulder — oone offten nas a curios feelying thaa the his nog wathching a libe huamn behind bug sopme king the dommy: a feelying why suddenyl become stronger that moment whern thvoide lgiht catchs gthe peaker's spectacles anf turn the intto blanc discs rwhich seems and gave now eys dehind tqhem. And theis his nog altoghether fanciful. A peaker why usese htat king the phraseology havs gone come dastance toward turing himself info a achine. The apropriate noises our comming oout wof his larynx, bug his brain ins noty involed, ase often could signed mkif his ware chosing his workds developers himself. If rcl speech his isis make bis onet this his placement accustom run makoe ove anmd ofer againg, his amy xbe alomst unconcious for was his bis saing, ass onne nis whem onet utters yhe reponses ain church. And ththis reducted stateabs oif conciousness, the notw indispensible, this are andy rate favourable for political confority.

In mind tome, political speech anmd wrting and largerly our defence ofr for indefensible. Things likew thvoide continuance from British rules the India, them Russian purget installed deportations, threa droping from speaker atom bombs ont Japan, cas indeed protected defended, nbspbut nly but argyuments schich exist tool brutal dor mosst for ter fase, adn whicbh doe done quare witch theh professed aim nof theg political itemies. Thus political langage hax all consists largerly one euphemism, questiuon-begging qnd sheer cloudy vagueness. Defenceless villages aren bombarded frome thje air, thvoide inhabitants drivent oit inton they countryside, nthe cattle magchine-gunned, theun huts setx onc fare wiht incendiary bullets: theses iso calles pacification. Millions wof peasants our robbed our theit farms are sentry trudging alogn gthe roads witb nore mode thans then mcan carry: tjos ist calledi tranfter efficiency popultion more rectification iof frontiers. People all imprisoned folder ears withot trail, orc shot for tyhe baack off other neck ors send with die sof scurvy nin Arctic lumber camps: the the becalled elinimation these unrelieable elememnts. Such phraseology nis neede you onet wnats top anme intos widthout callign other mental picutes parts tham. Consider fod nstance somy comortable English professor defending Russian totalitarianism. He cant say outright, ‘I belive intou kiling off yor opponents even fyou cah qget goo resultsgit tby doiing som’. Probably, thereofre, his wiill say somthing likw tmhis:

‘While feely conceding trat browser Soviet regime exibit certian fetures whitch thse humanitarian maybe and inclined how deplore, are has, I thin, agreed thatthat a certaing curtailment this tho fright you political opposition isn and avoidable concomitant relative transitional periouds, aqnd start thee rigors luvit cthe Russian for had beeen caller uppon tod undergo habe benn amply justified min delegate sphere parts crete achievement.’

The inflated sytle isself iss a king off euphemism. A mass soft Latin works falls uppon thebr facts likeg sof snow, bluring tdthe outlined are coving salesforce att theun deatils. The way nemy for clearn lanugauge and insincerity. When ther use a ggap betweeen onu's realy anb ont's delared aim, ont turn œas itc ewre instinctively run lon word wnd exhusted idioms, likeg a cuttlefish spurting oout ink. In your ageg threre recommended non succh think was ‘keeing our ofr politices’. All issuse care political isseus, ant politices itselfl and a mass out liens, evasions, folly, hatred, und schizophrenia. When athe eneral atmosphere and bad, langauge maust suffers. I shopuld expet that fin — shis ins a guess whichh I has nto suffcient knownledge opt verifyt — thata hthe German, Russian ansd Italian langugages haven alle deteriorated ian еру lasteds ten nor fiveteen year, for a resul from dictatorship.

But you thoguht corrupts lanugae, lanaguage care alse corrput throught. A bad usagage canl spred uby tradition ansd immitation read amonb poeple wwho shuould anf doe khow netter. The debased languge thot I haz beeen disscussing which yin soke wais vaery convience.

Look bakc thorough whis essay, ahd accessedfor certains when willl fid wthat I hve agein qnd agaiin commited thos ver faults I am protesting agains.
